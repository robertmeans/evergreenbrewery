		<p>Welcome to Evergreen Brewery and Tap House</p>
		<p>We are so happy to share this dream with all of you. 30 years ago Casey Boone had a vision of a community based retail store that would bring the beauty of the outdoors to all of the families of Evergreen. As he made that vision come true, friends and family would always come to see Casey not only for his expert advise on the latest and greatest but to hang out in the Wapiti lounge; which meant time to for tequila shots. This is where the concept of the bar was born.  28 years later the dream became reality. With the help of new and old friends we were able to build this beautiful space above Boone Mountain Sports, with amazing views of Bergen Peak and Elk Meadow. If it werenâ€™t for the friends and family that helped, none of this would have been possible! Thank You all.  At Evergreen Brewery we pride ourselves on bringing our patrons only the best in quality, from our food to our delicious beer. So Please come in and become part of the family! Thank you for the continued patronage and enjoy your time at EBTH. </p>
